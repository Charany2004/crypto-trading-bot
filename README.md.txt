# Python Crypto Trading Bot (Mock Version)

This is a mock implementation of a simplified trading bot developed for the hiring task.

## Features
- Takes user input (API key, order type, etc.)
- Simulates order using mock Binance client
- Logs order result to bot.log

## Note
Binance Testnet API was unavailable, so a mock client is used to simulate trading.
